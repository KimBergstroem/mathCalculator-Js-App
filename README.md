## Overview

The Calculator Project is a web application created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a fun and interactive way for users to test their math skills. 
The project features four different game modes: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Upon selecting a game mode, the project generates two random numbers within a specified range and displays them on the screen with the appropriate math operator. Users then input their answer, and the project checks whether it is correct or incorrect. After each question, the project displays the user's score and offers the option to continue playing or start a new game.
